My weather api project is a FAILURE. I seriously need to look into Javascript more to understand hoe to make things work

This project was my attempt to create a weather operating system utilizing javascript which is no where near succesful.

My motivation ws that I want to be a highly sought after full stack software developer. I'm attempting to test my skills in Javascript and determine how much i need to improve. The problem is that I'm nowhere near where I need to be in javascript. I learned that I even more to learn in relation to software development but if I perservere then I will succeed.

In order to install this project I first had to determine psuedo code. Then I had to determine the the functions that I would use to create the password generator. Then I had to test the functions in the browser and check the console elements for any faulty code. However my project still ins't ready to deploy.

This project is not utilizable at this time. Please check back later. Nothing follows.
